## Abstract
Deep learning (DL) has significantly advanced Industry $4.0$ by leveraging data from the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for smart manufacturing and product marketing. However, multimodal industrial data presents challenges for traditional frameworks. This paper introduces an efficient product retrieval framework for e-commerce systems, addressing privacy and performance challenges through federated learning (FL). Specifically, we propose FLARE, a novel part retrieval system where distributed warehouses collaboratively train a multimodal foundation model, CLIP, by fine-tuning only the Adapter module via FL, ensuring data privacy and efficiency. Experiments on the Industrial Language-Image Dataset (ILID) highlight the framework's effective privacy safeguards and strong retrieval capabilities. FLARE represents the first application of FL for industrial product retrieval, optimizing part searches, inventory management, and customer experience while maintaining data security.
